These are the beliefs I carry into my work as a developer and into daily life.
I believe in them and try to follow them consistently.

## Be a product designer, not just an engineer

Writing code is only part of the job. I want to understand the problem behind
the task, the user behind the metrics, and the impact behind the feature. That
means asking why, exploring tradeoffs, and thinking about how the product feels
in real life. When I think like a product designer, I build features that make
sense, not just features that ship.

## Create a strong portfolio inside the company

I treat every project as a chance to leave a visible, positive footprint. That
means documenting my work, sharing learnings, and making improvements that other
teams can benefit from. A strong internal portfolio builds trust and opens
future opportunities.

## Concentration matters

I protect my concentration because it is the foundation of good work. The
Pomodoro method helps me stay focused, take healthy breaks, and keep my energy
steady throughout the day.

## Responsibility is a key value

Responsibility is a key value. I bring it into my everyday work. I take ownership
of the tickets I pick up, and I accept the challenges that come with them.

## I choose healthy environments

I choose environments that are healthy, respectful, and safe as a first
priority. When the environment is positive, my motivation, concentration, and
overall performance stay strong.
