# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website.

The site is intentionally simple.  
Its purpose is to document how I think, build, and learn as a frontend engineer — and to serve as a long-term home for projects, writing, and products I build over time.

---

## Motto

> **Build real things.  
> Explain the tradeoffs.  
> Improve in public.**

## What this site is for

- Sharing production-style React projects
- Writing about frontend architecture and real-world decisions
- Documenting open-source contributions
- Gradually showcasing products and experiments I build

This is not a marketing site.  
It’s a living workspace.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- MDX for writing
- Deployed on Vercel
 - Angular
 - Vue
 - lit-element

## Philosophy

I believe good engineering is not about chasing tools or trends.

It’s about:
- Choosing the right abstraction for the problem
- Writing code that can be understood months later
- Communicating decisions clearly
- Shipping, learning, and iterating

This site reflects that mindset.

## Status

Actively evolving.  
New posts, projects, and experiments are added incrementally.
